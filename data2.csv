I am in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters

I got a selfie with Oprah, I just ain't never post it

And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frown since '06

I ain't cried since '01, my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun

You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute but it's fine though

We gon' end on a high note


I spy with my little eye

A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes

A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife

Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

Oh, I spy with my little eye

A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes

A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife

Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind",
