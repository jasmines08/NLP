I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct

We hate the bitches you fuck, 'cause they confuse themself with real women

And notice, I said ""we,"" it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'

How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?

How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?

Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us

Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush",
258,Selena Gomez,Wolves,"
I've been running through the jungle 

I've been crying with the wolves 

To get to you, to get to you

I've been down the darkest alleys 

Saw the dark side of the moon 

To get to you, to get to you

I've looked for love in every stranger 

Took too much to ease the anger

All for you, yea all for you 

I've been running through the jungle 

I've been crying with the wolves 

to get to you, oh to get to you


Your fingertips trace my skin 

To places I have never been 

Blindly I am following 

Break down these walls and come on in 

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night 

Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky",
87,Chris Brown,Back to Sleep,"
I know you got work pretty early

I'll be around 'bout 3:30

Usually you done by one

So baby when I wake you up


Just let me rock, fuck you back to sleep girl

Don't say a word no, now don't you talk

Just hold on tight to me girl

Fuck you back to sleep girl, rock you back",
131,Rihanna,Love on the Brain,"
Baby, you got me like ah, woo, ah!

Don't you stop loving me? (loving me)

Don't quit loving me (loving me)

Just start loving me (loving me)


Oh, and baby I'm fist fighting with fire

Just to get close to you

Can we burn something, babe?

And I run for miles just to get a taste

Must be love on the brain",
