Wake up everyday, somebody harrassin' me

I got rich, they need money, they askin' me

I was sittin' in jail, they ain’t look out for me

Ones who need me the same ones who doubted me

I been handlin' my own, they can vouch for me

Turn the heat up, ain't nobody hot as me

Everywhere dollars be, that's how I gotta be

And I'm savin' for the bigger picture, know one day I’ll need 'em

Might as well get used to me

My biggest fear is endin' up how I used to be, yeah",

Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait

He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away

I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut

'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough

Before I left, he hugged my neck and said


Just 'cause you're leavin'

It don't mean that I won't be right by your side

When you need me

And you can't see me in the middle of the night

Just close your eyes and say a prayer

It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here

But I'll always be right there

Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere",

Don't you just wanna wake up

Dark as a lake

Smelling like a bonfire

Lost in a haze?

If you're drunk on life, babe

I think it's great

But while in this world


I think I'll take my whiskey neat

My coffee black and my bed at three

You're too sweet for me

You're too sweet for me

I take my whiskey neat

My coffee black and my bed at three

You're too sweet for me

You're too sweet for me",
732,Jelly Roll,Need a Favor,"
I know Amazing Grace, but I ain't been livin' them words

Swear I spend most Sundays, drunk off my ass, than I have in church

Hard cover King James only been savin' dust on the nightstand

And I don't know what to say by the time I fold my hands


I only talk to God when I need a favor

And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer

So, who the hell am I, who the hell am I

To expect a Savior o-o-oh

If I only talk to God when I need a favor

God I need a favor

Amen. Amen.",
