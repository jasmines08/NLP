Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at

Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J

Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave",
533,Justin Bieber,Holy,"
I don't do well with the drama

And, no, I can't stand it being fake

(No, no, no, no, no, no, no)

I don't believe in nirvana

But the way that we love in the night gave me life

Baby, I can't explain


That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy

On God

Runnin' to the altar like a track star

Can't wait another second

'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

Feels so holy",
