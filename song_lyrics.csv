""Climb in, "" and then she climbed

Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe

With a tear in her blood-stained shirt

She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to

I knew what had happened to her

I didn't load her down with questions

That girl had been through enough

I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes

And I asked her where he was

I don't know if he's an angel

'Cause angels don't do what he did

He was hellbent to find the man behind

All the whiskey scars I hid

I never thought my day of justice

Would come from a judge under a seat

But I knew right then I'd never get hit again

When he said to me

""Wait in the truck

Just wait in the truck""

Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came

So I kicked in his double-wide door

I let the hammer drop before he got

To that 12 he was reaching for

I didn't try to hide my pistol

I didn't even try to run

I just sat on the porch, smoking one of his cigarettes

And waited for the cops to come

I don't know if he's an angel

'Cause angels don't do what he did

He was hellbent to find the man behind

All the whiskey scars I hid

I never thought my day of justice

Would come from a judge under a seat

Have mercy on me

Have mercy on me (hey), Lord

It's been 60 months and she still comes

To see me from time to time

It was worth the price, to see a brighter side

Of the girl I picked up that night

And I might be here forever

It ain't paradise, that's true

But it's whole hell of a lot better

Than the place I sent him to, yeah
