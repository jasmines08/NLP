752,Hardy,Wait in the Truck,"I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Working my way through a middle-of-June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was something in the headlights
It stopped me on a dime

Well, she was scared to death, so I said

""Climb in, "" and then she climbed

Oh, yeah

Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe

With a tear in her blood-stained shirt

She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to

I knew what had happened to her

I didn't load her down with questions

That girl had been through enough

I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes

And I asked her where he was

I don't know if he's an angel

'Cause angels don't do what he did

He was hellbent to find the man behind

All the whiskey scars I hid

I never thought my day of justice

Would come from a judge under a seat

But I knew right then I'd never get hit again

When he said to me

""Wait in the truck

Just wait in the truck""

Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came

So I kicked in his double-wide door

I let the hammer drop before he got

To that 12 he was reaching for

I didn't try to hide my pistol

I didn't even try to run

I just sat on the porch, smoking one of his cigarettes

And waited for the cops to come

I don't know if he's an angel

'Cause angels don't do what he did

He was hellbent to find the man behind

All the whiskey scars I hid

I never thought my day of justice

Would come from a judge under a seat

But I knew right then I'd never get hit again

When he said to me

""Wait in the truck

Just wait in the truck""

Whoa (whoa)

Have mercy on me, Lord

Have mercy on me

Have mercy on me (hey), Lord

It's been 60 months and she still comes

To see me from time to time

It was worth the price, to see a brighter side

Of the girl I picked up that night

And I might be here forever

It ain't paradise, that's true

But it's whole hell of a lot better

Than the place I sent him to, yeah

Wait in the truck (have mercy on me)

Just wait in the truck

And I know it wasn't right but it was fucking with my head

And everything deleted like the past, yeah it was gone

And when I touched your face, I could tell you were moving on

But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday

It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake

And everything I know tells me that I should walk away

But I just want to stay",Sadness

I was nodding off, they woke up a beast

Struggle what made me, we used to have water for dinner, we didn't have nothin' to eat

Soon as I get on his ass, they gon' look at me better, like, ""Damn, he was fuckin' with me,"" yeah

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)",

I won't let go

I'll be your lifeline tonight

I won't let go

I'll be your lifeline tonight


'Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?

It's how we learn and how we grow

And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old

You shouldn't be fighting on your own",

'Cause I'm a real tough kid

I can handle my shit

They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it""

And I did

Lights, camera, bitch, smile

Even when you want to die

He said he'd love me all his life

But that life was too short

Breaking down, I hit the floor

All the pieces of me shattered

As the crowd was chanting ""More!""

I was grinning like I'm winning

I was hitting my marks

'Cause I can do it with a broken heart


I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday

Every day

I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me

Like the plague

I cry a lot, but I am so productive

It's an art

You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart",
