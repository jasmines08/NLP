Eat it like I need an apron on (Yeah, oh)

We could do it to your favorite song (Yeah, ayy)

Take a ride into the danger zone

It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)

Waste the day and spend the night

Underneath the sunrise

558,Wizkid,Essence,"
Say I wanna leave you in the mornin'

But I need you now, yeah, yeah

I find you, I give you all you needin'

I know you what you like

I feel it comin'

Time is of the essence

I tried to teach you

But I'm gon' need some lessons

I need to give it all

I tried to leave but I can't

I don't know why, you're the one

Turn me out of my mind


You don't need no other body

You don't need no other body",
595,BRS Kash,Throat Baby (Go Baby),"
Got a lil' hundred, that's if you want it

Extra lil' forty, gotta come right now

And I got beans you bite down

Super good head, no cap, gown

Since the first time, I been fiendin', couldn't even believe it

Head like that, shit, pussy, don't need it

When she get hungry, she eat my semen

Balls and all, with her mouth, she clean it

Washing machine trick, ooh

Shawty got mean grip, ooh

Know what she came to do

Suck this dick, then she dip, ooh

Head monster, set an appointment

My soul wet, need your anointing

Way too good, may buy you somethin'

Made a whole song, see, I ain't frontin'

I shoot the world for you

I go to war for you

Damn, bae got me trippin'

BOA head, make me cum instant

She ain't even gotta ask for attention (Why?)

'Cause I'ma give it to her (What else?)

Money, I give it to her

Clock on rocks, I give it to her


Sexy lil' bitch, sexy lil' ho

I love the way you walk, love the way you talk

Let a young nigga come play in your throat

Deep stroke your throat 'til I make you choke

Throat babies, I'm tryna give 'em to you

Throat babies, I'm tryna bust all on you

Sexy lil' bitch, sexy lil' ho

I love the way you walk, love the way you talk

Let a young nigga come play in your throat

Deep stroke your throat 'til I make you choke

Throat babies, I'm tryna give 'em to you

Throat babies, I'm tryna bust all on you",
419,Lewis Capaldi,Before You Go,"
So, before you go

Was there something I could've said

To make your heart beat better?

If only I'd've known you had a storm to weather

So, before you go

Was there something I could've said

To make it all stop hurting?

It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

So, before you go


Was never the right time, whenever you called

Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all

Our every moment, I start to replay it

But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face",
454,JP Saxe,If the World Was Ending,"
I know you know we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine

I know you know we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine


But if the world was ending you'd come over, right?

You'd come over and you'd stay the night

Would you love me for the hell of it?

All our fears would be irrelevant

If the world was ending you'd come over right?

The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight

And there wouldn't be a reason why

We would even have to say goodbye

If the world was ending you'd come over, right? Right?

If the world was ending you'd come over, right? Right?",
106,Sam Hunt,Body Like a Back Road,"
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt

But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help

Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet

It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets


Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed

I know every curve like the back of my hand

Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry

I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can",
734,Luke Combs,Love You Anyway,"
There's just some things that leave a man no choice

Like a compass needle needing its true north

Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks

Oh, I'd love you anyway


I know just tryin' to write a song

I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong

And well I guess what I'm tryin' to say

Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

And if you turned your back on me and walked away

Not a thing about the way I feel would change",
23,Major Lazer,Cold Water,"
I won't let go

I'll be your lifeline tonight

I won't let go

I'll be your lifeline tonight

It's how we learn and how we grow

And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old

You shouldn't be fighting on your own",
126,Kyle,iSpy,"
I ain't been gettin' high...

Well maybe a little, baby I don't wanna lie

I know when you text me girl, I don't always reply

Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly

I notice, you think that you know shit

All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it

They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus

That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit

Otay, pray them niggas go away

Always hella clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil

This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways

This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day

Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it

I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in

I am in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters

I got a selfie with Oprah, I just ain't never post it

And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frown since '06

I ain't cried since '01, my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun

You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute but it's fine though

We gon' end on a high note


I spy with my little eye

A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes

A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife

Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

Oh, I spy with my little eye

A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes

A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife

Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind",
